# NLUTimer

This is a Mac OSX app that shows timer in the menu bar. This timer accepts inputs like `1h 30m`, `1483s`, etc. When time's up, the timer will send a notification and play a music to alert users.

## How to Install

Just download this timer from here and double-click it.

## How to Use

After open this timer, it'll show up a textfield for typing. Just input the amount of time that you want to countdown.

To stop the music while time's up, click menu bar icon or click on the notification it sends.

There is a default shortcut `⌥⌘k` (Option+Command+k) to show/hide this timer.
